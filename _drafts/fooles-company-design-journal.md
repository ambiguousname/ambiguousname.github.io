## Week 3 of Fall
I guess we're doing this. This whole idea started I-don't-know-how-many-years-ago when I wrote down an idea in the ideas section of my phone:

```
Card game where the player's teams and strategies are fluid.
Elaborating: Two players have teams, and they have to play cards to get other players on their teams. That means utnil the other players are recruited for a team, they have to develop a strategy that will work for either team.
```

I won't bother explaining what I mean by the above, because usually when I write down ideas it makes no sense to anyone but me. And if I ever do start working on an idea, it always comes out radically different from whatever I wrote down. But it's a good starting point.

When I started taking ARTG 80G in fall, and I heard that we were only making a card game, I thought about iterating on it, with one major twist:

The card game should be really basic in scope. One mistake I always make is adding more complicated features that sound really cool, but that I don't have time to elaborate on or tweak.

So how do you scale that down?

1. Make the game playable only between two players. That drastically reduces the need for balance.
2. Limit the total number of cards available. I was thinking of 10-12 cards total.
   a. Each player would draw five cards each from a shared pile.
   b. There might be like 2 unused cards, but that could create some interesting ideas.
3. To focus on fluidity, make it so that every card is unique.
    a. This is probably going to be hard to balance, but it's a challenge I really want to try.
    b. To mitigate the issue of players being able to see each other's cards to formulate strategies in advance, I'm borrowing Coup's system of hiding the cards/roles you have from your opponent. So you can make deductions of what your opponent probably has during play.

I was also inspired by Hearts (my dad was playing it consistently while I was home for the summer), and the idea of needing to lose cards. And I was also maybe inspired by the idea of swapping cards? So you're potentially more powerful while you have more cards, but you need to become less powerful in order to win.

So then came the idea:
Foole's Company - A game where you are the leader of an incompetent mercenary company, facing off against the leader of yet another incompetent mercenary company. You want to ditch your mercenaries before they get you killed.

### Current Goals
1. Pure strategy
   a. I don't want any luck to be involved. I haven't made a lot of games like this, so I think it'd be a good challenge.
   b. Creates a nice consequence that part of the game is going to be based on the available information you have.
2. Limited interactions/Simple mechanics
    a. Mostly for scope reasons, but I also think that if I focus on making things simple and/or easy to read, then it could create some complex strategies.
    b. You know, "easy to learn, hard to master"

### Current Rules
I've already iterated on this several times in my head, but here's what I have so far:

It's a 1v1 game. Two players only.

Each player draws 5 cards from the deck, keeping them hidden from each other. 2 cards remain in the center, face down. Every card is unique and has a unique ability.

At the start of the game, each player has 30 life tokens.

There will be some arbitrary process for deciding who goes first.

A player will lose X life tokens per turn, where X is the number of cards they have in their hand. So if a player ends a turn with 5 cards in their hand, they lose 5 life tokens.

Each card has abilities that can be activated for a certain number of life tokens. On their turn, a player selects as many cards as they'd like (introduce a limit?), reveals them to the other player and picks ONE ability from each card they have selected to use. (I might add cards where you have to store life tokens on them over multiple turns before activating? That allows you to hide more information over multiple turns)

The game ends when one player runs out of life tokens or loses all of their cards.

That's it! Excited to make some cards for this.

### Visual Style #1
So obviously, this shares *some* similarities with Magic the Gathering, because what's wrong with the classics?

You know, standard stuff! Name at the top, image in the center, abilities below:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/design1.png)

Personally, I'm a big fan of minimalism (and in all honesty, minimal drawing is the only kind of drawing I can really do). So I just went for some really simple shapes.

I spent like 30 minutes or so designing a really basic rose out of a few shapes. I don't know if anyone else will interpret it as a rose, but that's what it's meant to be. Or at least a flower.

### Visual Style #2

I've kept the icons because I worked on them for longer than I probably should have, and I don't want to spend time designing new icons. They're pretty cool though, right? Well, the life counter icons probably need some work. But I kinda like the card back icon, so it's staying:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/design2.png)

I also messed around with some font changes. It looks nice! I'm a little worried about readability, but I like `High Tower Text` as a font. Maybe I should ditch the cursive though for the card titles.

I've included the card name on the back as well as maybe another way of messing with information? I wonder if I should make it clear what cards everyone is holding? Something to experiment with, I guess.

I also tried making the information on the card a lot clearer, so there's no card icon. Just text, as well as a nice quote on the bottom. That means I can make the text bigger if I want, so there's less clutter going on.

### Visual Style #3

Alright, one more:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/design3.png)

I thought maybe the back of the card wasn't crowded enough, so I added some more symmetry to make it look better? I also tried to stick with one font, and focused on removing as much unnecessary text as possible. It looks cleaner, but I'm not particularly thrilled because I kind of like writing quotes. Art is not my strong suit.

One potential thought, making the front and back of the card the same? Especially if I want people to be able to read information from other's hands.

## Week 4 of Fall

I had the weekend to think, so when I thought of something, I wrote it down!

Here are some card ideas:

Old Coot - Spontaneous Organ Failure, Back In My Day

Overeager Tactician - Useless Stratagem

Egomaniacal Fencer - Pure Bluster

Fraudulent Accountant - Tax Evasion

Muddled Magician - Runcible Spoon

Rebellious Youth - Reckless Endangerment, Child's Play

Clown - Honk

Bumbling Patroller - Must have been nothing

Useless Underminer - Do Nothing

Impious Pretender - Disheartening Service

Devious Drunkard - Extreme Hangovers


And some potential card abilities:

Swap cards with your opponent

Use one of your opponent's abilities (high cost + the ability's cost?)

Counterattack - Put life tokens on the character, if anything BUT the card is attacked, do life token damage or remove cards?

Other counterattack: Play immediate life tokens to stop any ability?

Directly attack opponent

Sap life tokens from opponent?

Reveal opponent cards (maybe by just asking if they exist?)

Heal yourself... somehow? Maybe by taking more cards?

Disable cards?

Give cards to your opponent (shouldn't be immediate)

Card is useless, discard for 4 extra life tokens???

Replace an ability's cost with drawing cards?

Rewind a turn?

Keep a card flipped over once it's been revealed.

And then I made this initial draft of cards yesterday (sort of, I updated the Accountant in between now and then):

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/initialcards.png)

I updated the visual direction. I updated the font (and made it bigger), and I tried to remove as much clutter as possible. It's just text now, because I like text. Yay.

Then I added the full set of cards that I plan on using in the final game (feel free to zoom in, it's high-res!):

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/fullcards.png)

I wanted 12 cards in total so that there would be 2 cards left over in an "unused" pile to contribute to the amount of misinformation that each player has. So initially, you're unsure of what cards your opponent has, and what's in the "unused" pile.

I also left a lot of the card descriptions vague on purpose to create for some interesting bending of the rules. This is obviously going to be super difficult to word correctly. But nonetheless, I have a plan. I need to write the rules first though:

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been assigned a completely meaningless role in some random backwater. Celebrate! We will also be giving you a crack-team of five specialists that you must pay out-of-pocket. What could make this deal better? Absolutely nothing, barring the possibility you somehow manage to ditch all "specialists" before they end up draining your supplies and accidentally killing you. Or getting rid of your opposing contract-holder so you can get the job done faster.

Foole's Company is a 1v1 strategy card game that relies almost completely on strategy. The only luck you'll see is at the beginning of the game. And speaking of:

#### Setting Up
1. Place all Foole's Company cards in the center.
2. Shuffle the cards.
3. Draw five cards each.
4. Any cards that you do NOT draw should remain there. They are now part of the "unused" pile. You might use these cards later.
5. Give each player 30 life tokens (the red blobs).
6. Pick a player to go first. We recommend you pick the player by rolling a die and seeing who gets the higher roll, but this process is entirely up to you.

That's it! You are now set up.

#### Cards
This is what cards will generally look like:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/cardexample.PNG)

When you execute a card's ability you will either: pay life tokens (as indicated above), or wait until a condition is met (mentioned for REACT abilities). 

See the "Vocabulary" section for more info on what each ability might ask of you.

See the "Card List" section for a full list of the available cards and their abilities.

#### Playing

The game is divided into turns, with each player taking a turn. Here's how the turn order goes:

1. The player places any number of their life tokens on as many of their cards as they so wish. This removes those life tokens from the player's pool, and they cannot be recovered (maybe change some card abilities and this rule to take advantage of this?). The recommended way of doing this is to remove the card from your hand and place it face-down, then place the life tokens on top of it. You can then peek at the card whenever you like in order to read it.
2. The player flips cards face up that they wish to play.
3. The player chooses ONE ability from each card that they wish to use.
4. The player executes each ability in whatever order they so desire. They must pay the associated life token cost with each ability. If the ability name has "react" in the text, it cannot be used. The "react" ability will specify conditions when it is activated on its own.
5. Once all abilities are executed, the player flips all their cards face-down, and removes as many life tokens from their pool as there are cards in their hand.
6. Then it's the opposing player's turn.

#### "Winning"

The game continues until one player is EITHER: Out of life tokens, or loses all their cards.

If a player runs out of life tokens, then the opposing player wins!

If a player loses all their cards, then they win!

(You may note that because of the way turns work, one player is going to run out of tokens faster than the other BUT also gets to play cards first. This is intentional)

#### Vocabulary

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

##### DISCARDing cards
As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. It is no longer apart of your hand.

##### SWAPping cards
When a card tells you to SWAP one card with another, that means you must physically switch their places. For example: say you own Card A in your hand, and your opponent has Card B in their hand. If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should place Card B in your hand, and Card A in your opponent's hand.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the unused pile and discard pile.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from your hand.

##### Pointing at a card
When a card tells you to "point at a card", that means to point at ANY card (as long as it belongs to this game, Foole's Company). Shuffling is STRONGLY discouraged. If a player is clever enough to figure out that the rules don't expressly forbid shuffling, they should make it clear to their opponent that they wish to allow shuffling. Even then, we would STRONGLY suggest that you only shuffle your cards at the start of your turn. Part of the game's design is meant to allow for the obfuscation of information, and information cannot stay constant if you're always shifting your cards around.

Any player violating the suggestions on implementing shuffling will automatically forfeit.

##### Naming a card
When a card tells you to "name a card", that means stating aloud the FULL name of whatever valid Foole's Company card you have in mind (we also suggest including a shit-eating grin for dramatic effect). So Debbie Downer can't say "I'm playing Reckless Endangerment, and I name the Accountant card". Exciting Edgar instead says "I PLAY RUNCIBLE SPOON! I AM TARGETING THE FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTANT!" You can say whatever you want to preface the name, just as long as you make it clear that the card name you are about to say is your intended target. For a list of card names (and their abilities), see the Card List below.

#### Card List
Working on this, not done yet!

#### Interpreting Rules
When in doubt, refer to the card's text. Then refer to these rules. Cards will usually lay out exceptions for the rules mentioned here, so those take precedent.

If you're still in doubt about what rule means what thing, consult a third party. The third party doesn't have to be neutral for them to interpret the rules, but ideally they will have played this game before so they can get a sense of the rules.

### End of Rules

After writing these rules, I realize that some card text doesn't match my intentions, so I'll update that.

## Week 5 of Fall
I revised the Old Coot card to be less powerful (and more interesting) based on feedback. Instead of dealing flat damage based on what's on the card, it deals damage based on what's on ALL of your cards. It makes losing cards more interesting. Especially once I update the rules to make mention that you KEEP life tokens on cards that you swap.

That means I also had to update the Fraudulent Accountant so that it doesn't trigger with every swap. That just makes things boring. 

Initially, I wanted to change it so that you could elect to do it, but then what's your incentive to use it? You take just as much damage as your opponent does. I thought about halving the damage you take, but then that creates a damage-spamming opportunity. So, why not just see how it plays out if you elect to take it? That way you can try to create opportunities where you swap with cards that have little life tokens, and yours have a lot. And why not make it more interesting? The tokens aren't removed after a swap, so you could be empowering your opponent.

I also realized the Devious Drunkard's and Useless Underminer's wordings were somewhat confusing, so I updated them. I also think Devious Drunkard's Double Hangover ability is not that valuable? I might re-word it later based on playtesting.

And now that I think about it, Egomaniacal Fencer is also underpowered.

With the cards mostly updated (I'm sure I'll find more problems with this week's playtest. I'm also still not super sold on Horn Guy, but I have yet to test him.), we're moving on to the rules!

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been assigned a completely meaningless role in some random backwater. Celebrate! We will also be giving you a crack-team of five specialists that you must pay out-of-pocket. What could make this deal better? Absolutely nothing, barring the possibility you somehow manage to ditch all "specialists" before they end up draining your supplies and accidentally killing you.

That's it! You are now set up.

#### Cards
This is what cards will generally look like:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/cardexample.PNG)
(TODO: Point to card description.)

When you execute a card's ability you will either: pay life tokens (as indicated above), or wait until a condition is met (mentioned for REACT abilities). 

See the "Vocabulary" section for more info on what each ability might ask of you.

See the "Card List" section for a full list of the available cards and their abilities.

#### Playing

The game is divided into turns, with each player taking a turn. Here's how the turn order goes:

1. The player flips cards face up that they wish to play. You may flip over as many cards as you wish.
2. The player chooses ONE ability from EACH card that they wish to use.
3. The player executes each ability in whatever order they so desire. They must pay the associated life token cost with each ability. If the ability name has "react" in the text, it cannot be used. The "react" ability will specify conditions when it is activated on its own.

5. The player returns all cards they have played to their hand.
6. Then it's the opposing player's turn.

#### Adding Life Tokens to Your Cards
Some cards will mention that they can have life tokens on them. In fact, ANY card may have life tokens. Here's how it works:

At the start of your turn (before you flip over the cards you wish to play), you may place life tokens on your cards.

Granted, the cards will be in your hand when you place life tokens on your cards. We recommend placing the card face down and placing life tokens on it. The card is still "in your hand", just on the table. You can still peek at the card underneath (or consult the Card List below) if you want to be reminded of what the card does.

You may place as many of your life tokens as you would like on as many cards as you would like. Once placed, these life tokens can never be recovered to your life pool (unless a card specifically states otherwise). So be careful! Once you place life tokens on your cards, there is little to no chance you will regain that health.

You may however, move life tokens from cards in your hand to other cards in your hand, provided you do so **AT THE START OF YOUR TURN**. All life tokens on cards must be distributed/re-distributed at the start of your turn (before you flip cards that you wish to play face-up).

#### Example Play
Let's say we have two opponents, each of equal wit:

General Vor, Terror of a Thousand Worlds, Butcher of Blveltka, etc., etc.

Quaigh

(TODO: Gonna add pictures. Sorry, please use your imagination!)
Vor and Quaigh begin by drawing five cards each from the center and placing 30 life tokens in their respective pools. They pull the cards they have drawn close to their chest, so as not to disclose what they have in their hands.

Quaigh shouts "I have Overeager Tactician, sweet!" as belies their intelligence. But Vor goes first, as General Vor the Undefeated is quite good at arm-wrestling; arm-wrestling was the method of contest that Quaigh and Vor chose to determine the first player.

Vor stays silent. They know that victory comes through silence. They will not reveal their cards.

Vor places 5 of their life tokens on card #1 in their hand, marking it by placing the card face down on the table and putting 5 life tokens on top of it.

Vor also places 5 of their life tokens on card #3.

Vor then flips over cards #2 and #4: Blithering Fool and Bumbling Patroller.

Vor activates ONE ability (as they can only activate one ability per card) from Blithering Fool as their first action: Misplaced Stockpile. Vor discards Card #5, but places it face-down so that Quaigh cannot see it. Because Vor has read the rules, and knows that cards can be placed into the discard face down. Quaigh has not read the rules, and does not know that they may flip cards over in the discard at any time.

Vor activates ONE ability from Bumbling Patroller: Sheer Ignorance. Vor plays 1 life token, and discards Card #2. Because of Sheer Ignorance's ability, Vor must skip as many turns as cards they have drawn. So they will skip their next turn.

Note that Vor has three cards left: Card #1 (Unknown), Card #3 (Unknown), and Card #4 (Bumbling Patroller). Vor could theoretically win in one more turn with Bumbling Patroller's Sheer Ignorance ability. Vor could not have won this turn because: 

1. There is no possible combination of cards to lose all of them in one turn (TODO: Actually check this lol)
2. Even if Vor reduced themselves to one card, that would leave them wide open to Quaigh's assualts for their next three turns (from Bumbling Patroller's ability.)

Vor also has 15 life tokens left, and now that it is the end of Vor's turn, they lose as many life tokens as there are cards in hand. So Vor loses 3 life tokens for the remaining 3 cards in their hand. 

Vor now has 12 life tokens.

So it's Quaigh's turn. If Quaigh was smart, they would know something's up, and would probably use the Overeager Tactician's Useless Stratagem to point at the Bumbling Patroller card and disable it. Then Quaigh could focus on discovering Card #1 and Card #2's abilities. But Quaigh is not smart.

Quaigh instead places 24 of their life tokens on card #4.  (TODO: Limit number of life tokens that can be placed on any card? I wanna see how this goes first.)

Quaigh flips over card #4 in their hand, Fraudulent Accountant. Quaigh has not read the rulebook, so Quaigh does not know that multiple cards can be flipped over, and that ONE ability from each can be played.

Quaigh uses the Fraudulent Accountant's Tax Evasion ability, and points at Card #4 in Vor's hand. Quaigh pays 3 life tokens and swaps Card #2 in their hand with the Bumbling Patroller. Because of Fraudulent Accountant's Arson reaction, Quaigh elects to deal 12 damage (half the number of life tokens on the card rounded down) to Vor, potentially winning the game.

But Vor reacts to Quaigh's reaction. And because it is not Vor's turn, Vor's reaction plays first. Vor flips over Card #1, Old Coot. Because Quaigh did NOT target Old Coot, Vor is able to react and steal half of the tokens on the Fraudulent Accountant card, and place it into Vor's own pool. (TODO: Add some more counters to Arson? Maybe? If this was targeted at Old Coot, then Quaigh wins easy. But part of countering is misinformation, so IDK yet.)

So now:

- Quaigh is at 3 life tokens.
- Vor is at 24 life tokens.

Vor skips a turn, but Quaigh is pretty much out of options. So Quaigh gives up, and does nothing on their turn. Then the 5 cards remaining in Quaigh's hand finish the job by putting Quaigh at -2 life tokens.

#### "Winning"

The game continues until one player is EITHER: Out of life tokens, or loses all their cards.

If a player runs out of life tokens, then the opposing player wins!

If a player loses all their cards, then they win!

(You may note that because of the way turns work, one player is going to run out of tokens faster than the other BUT also gets to play cards first. This is intentional)

#### Vocabulary

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

If two reactions from each player are to happen simultaneously, the player who does not have the current turn will go first in activating their reaction. 

##### DISCARDing cards
As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. It is no longer apart of your hand.

You may place a card into the discard face down, but anyone can flip any card over in the discard at any time.

##### SWAPping cards
When a card tells you to SWAP one card with another, that means you must physically switch their places. For example: say you have Card A in your hand, and your opponent has Card B in their hand. If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should place Card B in your hand, and Card A in your opponent's hand.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the unused pile and discard pile.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from your hand.

##### Pointing at a card
When a card tells you to "point at a card", that means to point at ANY card (as long as it belongs to this game, Foole's Company). Shuffling is STRONGLY discouraged. If a player is clever enough to figure out that the rules don't expressly forbid shuffling, they should make it clear to their opponent that they wish to allow shuffling.

You can say whatever you want to preface the name, just as long as you make it clear that the card name you are about to say is your intended target. For a list of card names (and their abilities), see the Card List below.

(TODO: I will add actual card text descriptions here when the final product is finished. I don't want to have to make it and then update with each new iteration.)

#### Interpreting Rules
When in doubt, refer to the card's text. Then refer to these rules. Cards will usually lay out exceptions for the rules mentioned here, so those take precedent.

If you're still in doubt about what rule means what thing, consult a third party. The third party doesn't have to be neutral for them to interpret the rules, but ideally they will have played this game before so they can get a sense of the rules.

### End of Rules


## Week 6 Fall

Made some revisions! Tweaked a few cards, totally revised what Horn Guy does (he's all about controlling what life tokens are on your opponent's cards, and using that to damage them). I want Egomaniacal Fencer to be powerful, but I toned down how much damage Pure Bluster does by 1.

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been assigned a completely meaningless role in some random backwater. Celebrate! We will also be giving you a crack-team of five specialists that you must pay out-of-pocket. What could make this deal better? Absolutely nothing, barring the possibility you somehow manage to ditch all "specialists" before they end up draining your supplies and accidentally killing you. Or getting rid of your opposing contract-holder so you can get the job done faster.

Foole's Company is a 1v1 strategy card game that relies almost completely on strategy. The only luck you'll see is at the beginning of the game. And speaking of:

#### Setting Up
1. Place all Foole's Company cards in the center.
2. Shuffle the cards.
3. Draw five cards each.
4. Any cards that you do NOT draw should remain there. They are now part of the "unused" pile. You might use these cards later.
5. Give each player 30 life tokens (the red blobs).
6. Pick a player to go first. We recommend you pick the player by rolling a die and seeing who gets the higher roll, but this process is entirely up to you.

That's it! You are now set up.

#### Cards
This is what cards will generally look like:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/cardexample.PNG)
(TODO: Point to card description.)

When you execute a card's ability you will either: pay life tokens (as indicated above), or wait until a condition is met (mentioned for REACT abilities). 

See the "Vocabulary" section for more info on what each ability might ask of you.

See the "Card List" section for a full list of the available cards and their abilities.

#### Playing

The game is divided into turns, with each player taking a turn. Here's how the turn order goes:

1. The player flips cards face up that they wish to play. You may flip over as many cards as you wish.
2. The player chooses ONE ability from EACH card that they wish to use.
3. The player executes each ability in whatever order they so desire. They must pay the associated life token cost with each ability from the life tokens in their pool or on their card.
   * If the ability name has "react" in the text, it cannot be used. The "react" ability will specify conditions when it is activated on its own.
4. Once all abilities are executed, the player flips all their cards face-down, and removes as many life tokens from their pool as there are cards that they own.
5. The player returns all cards they have played to their hand.
6. Then it's the opposing player's turn.

#### Adding Life Tokens to Your Cards
Some cards will mention that they can have life tokens on them. In fact, ANY card may have life tokens on it. Here's how it works:

At the start of your turn (before you flip over the cards you wish to play), you may place life tokens on your cards.

We recommend placing the card face down in front of you, then placing life tokens on top of it. The card is still "in your hand", just on the table.

You can still peek at the card underneath (or consult the Card List below) if you want to be reminded of what the card does.

At the start of your turn, place as many of your life tokens as you would like on as many cards as you would like.

Once placed on cards, life tokens can never be recovered to your life pool (unless a card specifically states otherwise). So be careful!

You may however, move life tokens from cards that you own to other cards that you own, provided you do so **AT THE START OF YOUR TURN**. All life tokens on cards must be distributed/re-distributed at the start of your turn (before you flip cards that you wish to play face-up).

#### Example Play
Let's say we have two opponents, each of equal wit:

General Vor, Terror of a Thousand Worlds, Butcher of Blveltka, etc., etc.

Quaigh

(TODO: Gonna add pictures. Sorry, please use your imagination!)
Vor and Quaigh begin by drawing five cards each from the center and placing 30 life tokens in their respective pools. They pull the cards they have drawn close to their chest, so as not to disclose what they have in their hands.

Quaigh shouts "I have Overeager Tactician, sweet!" as belies their intelligence. But Vor goes first, as General Vor the Undefeated is quite good at arm-wrestling; arm-wrestling was the method of contest that Quaigh and Vor chose to determine the first player.

Vor stays silent. They know that victory comes through silence. They will not reveal their cards.

Vor places 5 of their life tokens on the Card #1 that they own, marking it by placing the card face down on the table and putting 5 life tokens on top of it.

Vor also places 5 of their life tokens on card #3.

Vor then flips over cards #2 and #4: Blithering Fool and Bumbling Patroller.

Vor activates ONE ability (as they can only activate one ability per card) from Blithering Fool as their first action: Misplaced Stockpile. Vor discards Card #5, but places it face-down so that Quaigh cannot see it. Because Vor has read the rules, and knows that cards can be placed into the discard face down. Quaigh has not read the rules, and does not know that they may flip cards over in the discard at any time.

Vor activates ONE ability from Bumbling Patroller: Sheer Ignorance. Vor plays 1 life token, and discards Card #2. Because of Sheer Ignorance's ability, Vor must skip as many turns as cards they have drawn. So they will skip their next turn.

Note that Vor has three cards left: Card #1 (Unknown), Card #3 (Unknown), and Card #4 (Bumbling Patroller). Vor could theoretically win in one more turn with Bumbling Patroller's Sheer Ignorance ability. Vor could not have won this turn because: 

1. There is no possible combination of cards to lose all of them in one turn (TODO: Actually check this lol)
2. Even if Vor reduced themselves to one card, that would leave them wide open to Quaigh's assualts for their next three turns (from Bumbling Patroller's ability.)

Vor also has 15 life tokens left, and now that it is the end of Vor's turn, they lose as many life tokens as there are cards that they own. So Vor loses 3 life tokens for the remaining 3 cards that they own. 

Vor now has 12 life tokens.

So it's Quaigh's turn. If Quaigh was smart, they would know something's up, and would probably use the Overeager Tactician's Useless Stratagem to point at the Bumbling Patroller card and disable it. Then Quaigh could focus on discovering Card #1 and Card #2's abilities. But Quaigh is not smart.

Quaigh instead places 24 of their life tokens on card #4.  (TODO: Limit number of life tokens that can be placed on any card? I wanna see how this goes first.)

Quaigh flips over card #4 in their hand, Fraudulent Accountant. Quaigh has not read the rulebook, so Quaigh does not know that multiple cards can be flipped over, and that ONE ability from each can be played.

Quaigh uses the Fraudulent Accountant's Tax Evasion ability, and points at Card #4 that Vor owns. Quaigh pays 3 life tokens and swaps the Card #2 that they own with the Bumbling Patroller. Because of Fraudulent Accountant's Arson reaction, Quaigh elects to deal 12 damage (half the number of life tokens on the card rounded down) to Vor, potentially winning the game.

But Vor reacts to Quaigh's reaction. And because it is not Vor's turn, Vor's reaction plays first. Vor flips over Card #1, Old Coot. Because Quaigh did NOT target Old Coot, Vor is able to react and steal half of the tokens on the Fraudulent Accountant card, and place it into Vor's own pool. (TODO: Add some more counters to Arson? Maybe? If this was targeted at Old Coot, then Quaigh wins easy. But part of countering is misinformation, so IDK yet.)

So now:

- Quaigh is at 3 life tokens.
- Vor is at 24 life tokens.

Vor skips a turn, but Quaigh is pretty much out of options. So Quaigh gives up, and does nothing on their turn. Then the 5 cards that Quaigh owns finish the job by putting Quaigh at -2 life tokens.

#### "Winning"

The game continues until one player is EITHER: Out of life tokens, or loses all their cards.

If a player runs out of life tokens in their pool, then the opposing player wins! Life tokens on cards do NOT count towards the life tokens in your pool.

If a player loses all their cards, then they win!

(You may note that because of the way turns work, one player is going to run out of tokens faster than the other BUT also gets to play cards first. This is intentional)

#### Vocabulary

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

If two reactions from each player are to happen simultaneously, the player who does not have the current turn will go first in activating their reaction. 

##### DISCARDing cards
As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. You no longer own that card.

You may place a card into the discard face down, but anyone can flip any card over in the discard at any time.

##### SWAPping cards
When a card tells you to SWAP one card with another, that means you must physically switch their places. For example: say own Card A, and your opponent owns Card B. If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should move Card B to your cards, and Card A to your opponent's cards.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the unused pile and discard pile.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from your hand.

##### Pointing at a card
When a card tells you to "point at a card", that means to point at ANY card (as long as it belongs to this game, Foole's Company). Shuffling is STRONGLY discouraged. If a player is clever enough to figure out that the rules don't expressly forbid shuffling, they should make it clear to their opponent that they wish to allow shuffling. Even then, we would STRONGLY suggest that you only shuffle your cards at the start of your turn. Part of the game's design is meant to allow for the obfuscation of information, and information cannot stay constant if you're always shifting your cards around.

Any player violating the suggestions on implementing shuffling will automatically forfeit.

##### Naming a card
When a card tells you to "name a card", that means stating aloud the FULL name of whatever valid Foole's Company card you have in mind (we also suggest including a shit-eating grin for dramatic effect). So Debbie Downer can't say "I'm playing Reckless Endangerment, and I name the Accountant card". Exciting Edgar instead says "I PLAY RUNCIBLE SPOON! I AM TARGETING THE FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTANT!" You can say whatever you want to preface the name, just as long as you make it clear that the card name you are about to say is your intended target. For a list of card names (and their abilities), see the Card List below.

#### Card List

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/week5/cards2.png)

(TODO: I will add actual card text descriptions here when the final product is finished. I don't want to have to make it and then update with each new iteration.)

#### Interpreting Rules
When in doubt, refer to the card's text. Then refer to these rules. Cards will usually lay out exceptions for the rules mentioned here, so those take precedent.

If you're still in doubt about what rule means what thing, consult a third party. The third party doesn't have to be neutral for them to interpret the rules, but ideally they will have played this game before so they can get a sense of the rules.

### Optional Ruleset - Bidding War
Do you hate luck entirely? Well then, welcome to even more strategy!

This is an optional setup rule that you can use instead of randomly drawing cards or randomly determining who goes first:

1. Add 20 life tokens to your counter, so that you are now at 50 instead of 30.
2. Hide your life token counter from your opponent's view. Remove as many life tokens as you are willing to pay to go first. Your opponent will do the same.
3. Reveal on three. Whoever payed the most life tokens goes first. You do not regain your life tokens.
4. Shuffle the 12 Foole's company cards. Place them all face down in a row.
5. Whoever goes first picks a card. They can choose to add it to their hand for free. If the first player wishes to see the front of the card, they may pay 2 life tokens to do so. A player can choose not to draw a card after having seen it.
   * The opposing player can pay 2 life tokens to see the card that their opponent has selected.
   * If the opposing player decides they want the card (even if they haven't seen it), they may start a bidding war to own the card.
   * During a bidding war, you may bid life tokens against your opponent until one of you gives up. Whoever promises the highest amount of life tokens for the card at the end of the bidding war gets to add it to their hand while discarding the promised life tokens.
6. After the first player decides whether or not to add the card to their hand, the next player goes. The next player selects a card, following the process for step 5.
7. Keep going until each player has five cards in their hand. Put the 2 remaining cards into the unused pile. If you are above 30 life tokens, you must discard life tokens from your pool until you have 30 life tokens. Then play Foole's company as you normally would. 

### End of Rules

## Week 7 Fall
Most of this week's revision is focused on the rules. I think they're too long and complicate things too much.

So I've tried to simplify how using life tokens and your hand works so that it's less confusing overall. You no longer have a hand (well, you do), you just have cards in front of you that you can peek at. I've also tried to make the sample play much shorter (i.e., one round for each opponent) so that it's less about teaching strategy and more making sure you understand how to play very simply.

I also thought about the current dynamic I've been seeing in playtests, and tried to revise a lot of the card's rules to be simpler and/or more interesting and/or try to fit with the sense of balance.

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been assigned a completely meaningless role in some random backwater. Celebrate! We will also be giving you a crack-team of five specialists that you must pay out-of-pocket. What could make this deal better? Absolutely nothing, barring the possibility you somehow manage to ditch all "specialists" before they end up draining your supplies and accidentally killing you. Or getting rid of your opposing contract-holder so you can get the job done faster.

Foole's Company is a 1v1 strategy card game that relies almost completely on strategy. The only luck you'll see is at the beginning of the game. And speaking of:

#### The Play Area
![](/assets/images/fooles-company/PlayArea.png)

#### Setting Up
1. Place all Foole's Company cards in the center.
2. Shuffle the cards.
3. Draw five cards each.
4. Any cards that you do NOT draw should go into the discard, face down. These cards represent **your hand**.
5. Place your five cards in front of you, face down. You may peek at your cards any time you want, but DO NOT show them to your opponent.
6. Draw 30 life tokens each (the red blobs). These represent your **life token pool**.
7. Pick a player to go first. We recommend you pick the player by rolling a die and seeing who gets the higher roll, but this process is entirely up to you.

That's it! You are now set up.

#### Cards
This is what cards will generally look like:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/cardexample.PNG)
(TODO: Point to card description.)

When you execute a card's ability you will either: pay life tokens (as indicated above), or wait until a condition is met (mentioned for REACT abilities). 

See the "Vocabulary" section for more info on what each ability might ask of you.

See the "Card List" section for a full list of the available cards and their abilities.

#### Playing

The game is divided into turns, with each player taking a turn. Here's how the turn order goes (assuming that you are going first):

1. Remove life tokens from your **life token pool**, and place them on your cards.
   * Life tokens placed on cards can be redistributed at the start of your turn, but <u>cannot</u> be returned to your **life token pool** (unless a card ability says otherwise).
   * Life tokens remain on a card even if it is DISCARDed or SWAPped. 
2. Flip as many cards face-up from your hand as you wish.
3. Pick ONE ability from each face-up card to execute.
4. You may execute each ability you've selected in whatever order you desire.
5. Pay the associated life cost with the ability you've selected.
   * If the ability name has "react", the text will specify conditions when it is activated on its own. See the "REACT abilities" section for more information.
6. Once an ability is executed, flip the card face-down.
7. Remove as many life tokens from your **life token pool** as there are cards in your hand.
8. Your Turn Ends

You alternate turns with your opponent, until:

#### "Winning"

The game continues until one player is EITHER: Out of life tokens, or loses all their cards.

If a player runs out of life tokens in their **life token pool**, then the opposing player wins! Life tokens on cards do NOT count towards the life tokens in your pool.

If a player loses all their cards, then they win!

(You may note that because of the way turns work, one player is going to run out of tokens faster than the other BUT also gets to play cards first. This is intentional)

#### Example Turn
Let's say we have two opponents, each of equal wit:

General Vor, Terror of a Thousand Worlds, Butcher of Blveltka, etc., etc.

Quaigh

(TODO: Gonna add pictures. Sorry, please use your imagination!)
Vor and Quaigh begin by drawing five cards each from the center and placing 30 life tokens in their respective pools. They each place their five cards face down in front of them.

Vor peeks at all of their cards. They then distribute life tokens on their cards: 8 tokens on Vor Card #1, 5 on Vor Card #2, 2 on Vor Card #4, and 7 on Vor Card #5:

Vor then flips over Vor Cards #2 & #4: Useless Underminer and Rebellious Youth.

Vor activates Useless Underminer's "Useless" ability first, leaving the card face-up until the start of Vor's next turn. Vor removes 3 life tokens from Useless Underminer (the ability's cost), leaving 2 tokens remaining on the card:

Vor then activates Rebellious Youth's "Child's Play" ability. Vor removes 2 life tokens from Rebellious Youth (the ability's cost), leaving 0 life tokens remaining on the card. Vor points at Vor Card #1, Vor Card #3, and Vor Card #5. Quaigh selects Vor Card #5, and Vor places Card #5 in the discard:

Vor has played one ability from each card flipped over, so Vor flips the cards back over. Vor also removes 4 life tokens from their pool for each card in their hand. Vor's turn is over. Vor now has 11 cards in their pool, and 7 life tokens remaining on their cards:

It is Quaigh's turn. Quaigh places 10 tokens on Card #1, and flips over Quaigh Card #1: Fraudulent Accountant.

Quaigh pays 3 life tokens to use Tax Evasion, and swaps Fraudulent Accountant with Vor Card #2: Useless Underminer. Quaigh uses Fraudulent Accountant's "Arson" Reaction to remove life tokens from each of their pools based on the number of life tokens on the card they've each been given, halved and rounded down. Useless Underminer currently has 2 life tokens on it, so Quaigh removes 1 life token from their pool. Fraudulent Accountant has 7 life tokens on it, so Vor removes 3 life tokens from their pool:

Because Quaigh has used a REACTion, Vor flips over Card #1: Devious Drunkard, and uses the "Double Hangover" ability to remove 5 life tokens from Quaigh's life token pool:

And thus ends a sample set of turns! What will happen next? Dunno, you figure it out.

#### Vocabulary

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it face up over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

"React" abilities cost no life tokens to use (unless specifically stated otherwise). React abilities can be used whenever and as frequently as possible, provided all conditions specified by the ability text are met.

Reactions are ENTIRELY OPTIONAL. You may choose to not use a reaction if you'd like.

If you are forced to skip a turn, reactions still take effect.

If a player has multiple reactions simultaneously, they may choose the order in which they execute those reactions.

If multiple reactions from each player occur simultaneoulsy, the player who does not have the current turn will go first in activating their reactions.

##### DISCARDing cards
As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. You no longer own that card.

If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should move Card B to your cards, and Card A to your opponent's cards.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the discard pile.

##### Skipping a turn
If a card tells you to skip a turn, that means that at the start of your *next* turn, your turn ends immediately.

You may still activate reactions if your turn has skipped.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from your hand.

##### Pointing at a card

### End of Rules

## Week 8 of Fall

This submission is a little late because I didn't see the assignment until an hour before the official due date closed. That being said, I'm still tweaking and trying to playest amidst my busy schedule, so I've mostly been tweaking the rules.

I playtested with my dad, who has a real eye for long-term strategies. It's something some of my playtests have been missing, since I've been trying to do "one and dones" to see how people could easily grasp the rules. Unfortunately, because of how complicated this game is on a mechanical level, I'm still struggling to try to explain the rules simply AND see how it works out in the long term. But we only have 10 weeks to develop it, and I have 2 weeks left. I think I've been putting off images for the sample play long enough, as well as color-coding. I will do that next week.

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been assigned a completely meaningless role in some random backwater. Celebrate! We will also be giving you a crack-team of five specialists that you must pay out-of-pocket. What could make this deal better?

#### Example Turn
Let's say we have two opponents, each of equal wit:

General Vor, Terror of a Thousand Worlds, Butcher of Blveltka, etc., etc.

Quaigh

(TODO: Gonna add pictures. Sorry, please use your imagination!)
Vor and Quaigh begin by drawing five cards each from the center and placing 30 life tokens in their respective pools. They each place their five cards face down in front of them.

Vor peeks at all of their cards. They then distribute life tokens on their cards: 8 tokens on Vor Card #1, 5 on Vor Card #2, 2 on Vor Card #4, and 7 on Vor Card #5:

Vor then flips over Vor Cards #2 & #4: Useless Underminer and Rebellious Youth.

Vor activates Useless Underminer's "Useless" ability first, leaving the card face-up until the start of Vor's next turn. Vor removes 3 life tokens from Useless Underminer (the ability's cost), leaving 2 tokens remaining on the card:

Vor then activates Rebellious Youth's "Child's Play" ability. Vor removes 2 life tokens from Rebellious Youth (the ability's cost), leaving 0 life tokens remaining on the card. Vor points at Vor Card #1, Vor Card #3, and Vor Card #5. Quaigh selects Vor Card #5, and Vor places Card #5 in the discard:

Vor has played one ability from each card flipped over, so Vor flips the cards back over. Vor also removes 4 life tokens from their pool for each card in their hand. Vor's turn is over. Vor now has 11 cards in their pool, and 7 life tokens remaining on their cards:

It is Quaigh's turn. Quaigh places 10 tokens on Card #1, and flips over Quaigh Card #1: Fraudulent Accountant.

Quaigh pays 3 life tokens to use Tax Evasion, and swaps Fraudulent Accountant with Vor Card #2: Useless Underminer. Quaigh uses Fraudulent Accountant's "Arson" Reaction to remove life tokens from each of their pools based on the number of life tokens on the card they've each been given, halved and rounded down. Useless Underminer currently has 2 life tokens on it, so Quaigh removes 1 life token from their pool. Fraudulent Accountant has 7 life tokens on it, so Vor removes 3 life tokens from their pool:

Because Quaigh has used a REACTion, Vor flips over Card #1: Devious Drunkard, and uses the "Double Hangover" ability to remove 5 life tokens from Quaigh's life token pool:

And thus ends a sample set of turns! What will happen next? Dunno, you figure it out.

#### Vocabulary

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it face up over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

"React" abilities cost no life tokens to use (unless specifically stated otherwise). React abilities can be used whenever and as frequently as possible, provided all conditions specified by the ability text are met.

Reactions are ENTIRELY OPTIONAL. You may choose to not use a reaction if you'd like.

If you are forced to skip a turn, reactions still take effect.

If a player has multiple reactions simultaneously, they may choose the order in which they execute those reactions.

If multiple reactions from each player occur simultaneoulsy, the player who does not have the current turn will go first in activating their reactions.

As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. You no longer own that card.

You may place a card into the discard face down, but anyone can flip any card over in the discard at any time.

If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should move Card B to your cards, and Card A to your opponent's cards.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the discard pile.

##### Skipping a turn
If a card tells you to skip a turn, that means that at the start of your *next* turn, your turn ends immediately. Even if your turn is skipped, you still lose as many life tokens from your pool as there are cards you own at the end of your turn.

You may still activate reactions if your turn has skipped.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from the cards you own.

##### Pointing at a card
When a card tells you to "point at a card", that means to point at ANY card (as long as it belongs to this game, Foole's Company). Shuffling is STRONGLY discouraged. If a player is clever enough to figure out that the rules don't expressly forbid shuffling, they should make it clear to their opponent that they wish to allow shuffling. Even then, we would STRONGLY suggest that you only shuffle your cards at the start of your turn. Part of the game's design is meant to allow for the obfuscation of information, and information cannot stay constant if you're always shifting your cards around.

Any player violating the suggestions on implementing shuffling will automatically forfeit.

##### Naming a card
When a card tells you to "name a card", that means stating aloud the FULL name of whatever valid Foole's Company card you have in mind (we also suggest including a shit-eating grin for dramatic effect). So Debbie Downer can't say "I'm playing Reckless Endangerment, and I name the Accountant card". Exciting Edgar instead says "I PLAY RUNCIBLE SPOON! I AM TARGETING THE FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTANT!" You can say whatever you want to preface the name, just as long as you make it clear that the card name you are about to say is your intended target. For a list of card names (and their abilities), see the Card List below.

(TODO: I will add actual card text descriptions here when the final product is finished. I don't want to have to make it and then update with each new iteration.)

#### Interpreting Rules
When in doubt, refer to the card's text. Then refer to these rules. Cards will usually lay out exceptions for the rules mentioned here, so those take precedent.

If you're still in doubt about what rule means what thing, consult a third party. The third party doesn't have to be neutral for them to interpret the rules, but ideally they will have played this game before so they can get a sense of the rules.

### Optional Ruleset - Bidding War
Do you hate luck entirely? Well then, welcome to even more strategy!

This is an optional setup rule that you can use instead of randomly drawing cards or randomly determining who goes first:

1. Write down an extra tally of 20 life tokens somewhere, so that you are now at 50 instead of 30.
2. Hide your life token counter from your opponent's view. Remove as many life tokens as you are willing to pay to go first. Your opponent will do the same.
3. Reveal on three. Whoever payed the most life tokens goes first. You do not regain your life tokens.
4. Shuffle the 12 Foole's company cards. Place them all face down in a row.
5. Whoever goes first picks a card. They can choose to add it to their hand for free. If the first player wishes to see the front of the card, they may pay 2 life tokens to do so. A player can choose not to draw a card after having seen it.
   * The opposing player can pay 2 life tokens to see the card that their opponent has selected.
   * If the opposing player decides they want the card (even if they haven't seen it), they may start a bidding war to own the card.
   * During a bidding war, you may bid life tokens against your opponent until one of you gives up. Whoever promises the highest amount of life tokens for the card at the end of the bidding war gets to add it to their hand while discarding the promised life tokens.
6. After the first player decides whether or not to add the card to their hand, the next player goes. The next player selects a card, following the process for step 5.
7. Keep going until each player has five cards in their hand. Put the 2 remaining cards into the discard pile. If you are above 30 life tokens, you must discard life tokens from your pool until you have 30 life tokens. Then play Foole's company as you normally would. 

### End of Rules

## Final Week

### The Rules

Congratulations, mercenary captain! You have been given the great honor of... hmmm. I can't seem to find the entry. It doesn't matter. Celebrate! Your compatriots are specialists all, and we've made them promise to stop accidentally killing people. Apropos of nothing, please don't try to kill the other mercenary captain here, or ditch any of your team. It's not something that happens, but **don't do it**.

Foole's Company is a 1v1 strategy card game that relies almost completely on strategy. You will try to get rid of your own mercenaries, deal damage to your opponent, all while taking damage from your own mercenaries every turn.

#### The Play Area
![](/assets/images/fooles-company/PlayArea.png)

#### Setting Up
1. Place all Foole's Company cards in the center.
2. Shuffle the cards.
3. Each player draws five cards. These represent the **cards you own**. Place them face down.
  * Feel free to peek at your cards at any time.
4. Place the rest of the cards into the discard, face down.
5. Set your life token counter to 30. This represents your **life token pool**.
6. Pick a player to go first. How you do this is up to you.

That's it! You are now set up.

#### Cards
This is what cards will generally look like:

![](/assets/images/fooles-company/cardexample.PNG)
(TODO: Point to card description.)

When you execute a card's ability you will either: pay life tokens placed on the card (cost indicated by ability), or wait until a condition is met (mentioned for REACT abilities).

See the "Vocabulary" section for more info on what each ability might ask of you.

See the "Card List" section for a full list of the available cards and their abilities.

#### Playing

The game is divided into turns, with each player taking a turn. Here's how the turn order goes (assuming that you are going first):

##### Phase One
You will place life tokens on your cards to pay for abilities for future phases/turns.

* During this phase, you may choose to remove life tokens from your **life token pool** and distribute them on your cards however you'd like. 
* Life tokens placed on cards can be redistributed at the start of your turn, but <u>cannot</u> be returned to your **life token pool** (unless a card ability says otherwise).
* Life tokens remain on a card even if it is DISCARDed or SWAPped.

If life tokens are distributed on your cards to your liking, move to Phase Two.
##### Phase Two
This phase, you will play abilities from your cards. Feel free to peek at your cards at any time.

For every card **face down that you own**, you can:
1. Flip that card over.
2. Pick ONE ability from that card to execute.
3. Pay the associated life cost using the life tokens on the card.
   * If the ability has "React" in the title, you cannot activiate it during this phase. The card will 
   * As soon as the ability is activated, remove the cost life tokens from the card. 
   * Keep any remaining life tokens on the card to be used later or for additional costs from the ability.

Any card you TAKE must be added to the cards you own face-up.

Once every card you intend to play has been played face-up, move onto Phase Three.

##### Phase Three
This phase, you will clean up your cards, take damage from the amount of cards you own, and prepare for your opponent's turn.

You must:
* Flip any cards face-down that you don't want face-up.
* Remove as many life tokens from your pool as there are cards you currently own.

Once you have taken damage, your opponent's turn begins, starting at Phase One.

##### At (Roughly) Any Time
At (almost) any time during your turns, you may:

* Activate a react ability, *IF the ability allows it.*
   * If a card you own has "React" in the title, it can be activated as soon as it meets specific requirements outlined by the card.
   * Keep an eye out for "If..." language at the start of the abilities description. That will tell you when the react ability can be activated.
* Flip a card you own face-down, **IF IT'S NOT PHASE TWO**.
   * Provided that you're currently not using that card's abilities, any card that is face-up may be flipped face-down if you're currently not in Phase Two of your turn.
   * If your opponent plays an ability that requires you to show your card to them, you must wait three seconds before flipping the card face-down again.

You alternate turns with your opponent, until:

#### Winning and Losing

The game continues until one player is EITHER: Out of life tokens, or loses all their cards.

If a player runs out of life tokens in their **life token pool**, then the opposing player wins! Life tokens on cards do NOT count towards the life tokens in your pool.

If a player loses all their cards, then they win!

(You may note that because of the way turns work, one player is going to run out of tokens faster than the other BUT also gets to play cards first. This is intentional)

#### Example Turn
Let's say we have two opponents, each of equal wit:

General Vor, Terror of a Thousand Worlds, Butcher of Blveltka, etc., etc.

Quaigh

(TODO: Gonna add pictures. Sorry, please use your imagination!)
Vor and Quaigh begin by drawing five cards each from the center and placing 30 life tokens in their respective pools. They each place their five cards face down in front of them.

Vor peeks at all of their cards. They then distribute life tokens on their cards: 8 tokens on Vor Card #1, 5 on Vor Card #2, 2 on Vor Card #4, and 7 on Vor Card #5:

Vor then flips over Vor Cards #2 & #4: Useless Underminer and Rebellious Youth.

Vor activates Useless Underminer's "Useless" ability first, leaving the card face-up until the start of Vor's next turn. Vor removes 3 life tokens from Useless Underminer (the ability's cost), leaving 2 tokens remaining on the card:

Vor then activates Rebellious Youth's "Child's Play" ability. Vor removes 2 life tokens from Rebellious Youth (the ability's cost), leaving 0 life tokens remaining on the card. Vor points at Vor Card #1, Vor Card #3, and Vor Card #5. Quaigh selects Vor Card #5, and Vor places Card #5 in the discard:

Vor has played one ability from each card flipped over, so Vor flips the cards back over. Vor also removes 4 life tokens from their pool for each card in their hand. Vor's turn is over. Vor now has 11 cards in their pool, and 7 life tokens remaining on their cards:

It is Quaigh's turn. Quaigh places 10 tokens on Card #1, and flips over Quaigh Card #1: Fraudulent Accountant.

Quaigh pays 3 life tokens to use Tax Evasion, and swaps Fraudulent Accountant with Vor Card #2: Useless Underminer. Quaigh uses Fraudulent Accountant's "Arson" Reaction to remove life tokens from each of their pools based on the number of life tokens on the card they've each been given, halved and rounded down. Useless Underminer currently has 2 life tokens on it, so Quaigh removes 1 life token from their pool. Fraudulent Accountant has 7 life tokens on it, so Vor removes 3 life tokens from their pool:

Because Quaigh has used a REACTion, Vor flips over Card #1: Devious Drunkard, and uses the "Double Hangover" ability to remove 5 life tokens from Quaigh's life token pool:

And thus ends a sample set of turns! What will happen next? Dunno, you figure it out.

#### Vocabulary

##### TAKE
When a card says to "take" a card, it's telling you to grab the card and add it to the cards you own, face-up.

You can flip this card face-down at any time OTHER than Phase Two, like any other card you own.

##### REACT abilities
Some cards will have text that says "React" above them. That just means that you won't activate them on their own, those will activate with conditions the card specifies. When a card's react ability is activated, you must flip it face up over to prove that you are using the reaction. 

"React" abilities cost no life tokens to use (unless specifically stated otherwise). React abilities can be used whenever and as frequently as possible, provided all conditions specified by the ability text are met.

Reactions are ENTIRELY OPTIONAL. You may choose to not use a reaction if you'd like.

If you are forced to skip a turn, reactions still take effect.

If a player has multiple reactions simultaneously, they may choose the order in which they execute those reactions.

If multiple reactions from each player occur simultaneoulsy, the player who does not have the current turn will go first in activating their reactions.

##### DISCARDing cards
As with all card games, you should have a discard pile. That is, a pile for getting rid of cards that will (most likely) no longer be used in the game. When a card tells you to DISCARD another card, place it in this discard pile. You no longer own that card.

You may place a card into the discard face down, but anyone can flip any card over in the discard at any time.

##### SWAPping cards
When a card tells you to SWAP one card with another, that means you must physically switch their places. For example: say own Card A, and your opponent owns Card B. If you play an ability where you SWAP Card A with Card B, then you should move Card B to your cards, and Card A to your opponent's cards.

This similarly goes for swapping with other piles. Provided it isn't expressly forbidden by the card, you can swap with the discard pile.

##### Skipping a turn
If a card tells you to skip a turn, that means that at the start of your *next* turn, your turn ends immediately. Even if your turn is skipped, you still lose as many life tokens from your pool as there are cards you own at the end of your turn.

You may still activate reactions if your turn has skipped.

##### LOSING Cards
When a card tells you about the loss of other cards (LOSE, LOSING, etc.), then it means when a card is EITHER discarded, swapped, or otherwise removed from the cards you own.

##### Pointing at a card
When a card tells you to "point at a card", that means to point at ANY card (as long as it belongs to this game, Foole's Company).

###### Shuffling
Shuffling is STRONGLY discouraged for new players. That's why it's hidden in this obscure corner of the rules (under the action that most loses from shuffling).

You may shuffle ANY of your FACE-DOWN cards at any time. If your card is face-up, you cannot shuffle it. You may hide your cards from your opponent while shuffling.

##### Naming a card
When a card tells you to "name a card", that means stating aloud the FULL name of whatever valid Foole's Company card you have in mind (we also suggest including a shit-eating grin for dramatic effect). So Debbie Downer can't say "I'm playing Reckless Endangerment, and I name the Accountant card". Exciting Edgar instead says "I PLAY RUNCIBLE SPOON! I AM TARGETING THE FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTANT!" You can say whatever you want to preface the name, just as long as you make it clear that the card name you are about to say is your intended target. For a list of card names (and their abilities), see the Card List below.

If you're still in doubt about what rule means what thing, consult a third party. The third party doesn't have to be neutral for them to interpret the rules, but ideally they will have played this game before so they can get a sense of the rules.

### Optional Ruleset - Bidding War
Do you hate luck entirely? Well then, welcome to even more strategy!

This is an optional setup rule that you can use instead of randomly drawing cards or randomly determining who goes first:

1. Write down an extra tally of 20 life tokens somewhere, so that you are now at 50 instead of 30.
2. Hide your life token counter from your opponent's view. Remove as many life tokens as you are willing to pay to go first. Your opponent will do the same.
3. Reveal on three. Whoever payed the most life tokens goes first. You do not regain your life tokens.
4. Shuffle the 12 Foole's company cards. Place them all face down in a row.
5. Whoever goes first picks a card. They can choose to add it to their hand for free. If the first player wishes to see the front of the card, they may pay 2 life tokens to do so. A player can choose not to draw a card after having seen it.
   * The opposing player can pay 2 life tokens to see the card that their opponent has selected.
   * If the opposing player decides they want the card (even if they haven't seen it), they may start a bidding war to own the card.
   * During a bidding war, you may bid life tokens against your opponent until one of you gives up. Whoever promises the highest amount of life tokens for the card at the end of the bidding war gets to add it to their hand while discarding the promised life tokens.
6. After the first player decides whether or not to add the card to their hand, the next player goes. The next player selects a card, following the process for step 5.
7. Keep going until each player has five cards in their hand. Put the 2 remaining cards into the discard pile. If you are above 30 life tokens, you must discard life tokens from your pool until you have 30 life tokens. Then play Foole's company as you normally would.
