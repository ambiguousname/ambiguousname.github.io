[Buy Indiepocalypse #55](https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-55), out now!

My game, Spider-880, is included in this month's issue<!--more-->. I'm ecstatic to get to my work published in some form; it's very validating.

You don't have to buy Indiepocalypse if you don't want to. [Spider-880](https://ambiguousname.itch.io/spider-880) has and continues to be free to download. As an extra incentive for you to buy the zine, I wrote a one-page postmortem for Spider-880 that is exclusive to Indiepocalypse. I love postmortems that really delve into thought processes behind technical and artistic decisions; I tried to cram most of what I could into one legible page for those interested.

Regardless of what you end up doing, I just hope this inspires you to check out Spider-880; I spent 3 months on the dang thing!

Thank you so much to the folks over at Indiepocalypse for accepting my submission, and thank you to everyone who helped during Spider-880's development. My family and [Overcast](https://overcastzombie.itch.io/) for testing, and [stargyaru](https://twitter.com/stargyaru) for working with me on the visuals and direction of the project.
