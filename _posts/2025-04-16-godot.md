image-alt: A black cat sticks her head under a giant black table. The sides of the table reach down just above the floor, so there's not a lot of room for her to squeeze under. There is a red button and some colorful lines on the surface of the table.

SUPER ULTRA RACING XTREME is no more<!--more-->.

Currently the table is sitting in my parent's house, seen in the photo to my right.

We had a good run! In the last month before we hauled the table away, we updated some of the art and added new gameplay modifiers and effects. Thank you to all the people from GDC who stopped by to check us out!

Though the table is no longer displaying publically, the story of SUPER ULTRA RACING XTREME is not entirely over. If you (or anyone you feel comfortable screaming enthusiastically at) is in the Boston area from May 5th-7th, [annalivia](https://annalivia.xyz) and I will be there for [GodotCon Boston](https://conference.godotengine.org/2025/schedule/). We're alllllll the way towards the end of the schedule, under **Lightning Talks!** We'll just be talking a little bit about how we made the table, and the important role that Godot played in making developing the game possible. It should be pretty cool!

## Final Thoughts

Super excited to see all of the other guest speakers at GodotCon, these talks all look fantastic. Hoping to meet some cool game dev folks in Boston and chat about making stuff!

If *you* want SUPER ULTRA RACING XTREME in YOUR space, let me know (`ambiguousname (at) ambiguous (dot) name`)! [annalivia](https://annalivia.xyz/) and I are open to suggestions.

Alright, bye!
