I worked on an add-on for Blender to let you import a sequence of LED coordinates, animate the colors, and export those colors as a .CSV file. It was made for [Stand-up Math's LED tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMRJf6B5Q4)!

You can try the add-on for yourself [here](https://github.com/ambiguousname/ParkerTreeBlenderAddOn).
