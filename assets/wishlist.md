This is a private page. Not that I mind you being here, it's just weird that you are. This is a private wishlist for things I want because Amazon's wishlist system is weird.

But it's also published on the internet, so... feel free to look at things I want? Not that you'll be able to do anything about it since you don't know where I live.
