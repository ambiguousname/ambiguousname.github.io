"Don't even think about it."

"What?"

"Sorry, just trying something out. I just always thought that'd be an amazing way to start a conversation."

"I like it. Strike fear into the hearts of whoever you're about to speak to."

"Do you feel fearful?"

"No, but I know you. On top of that, you tend to really be quiet. I think you'd do better at freaking people out if you yelled it."

"I might have, but then you might have been so scared that..." They both looked off of the roof of the incredibly tall building they were sat on.

"Good point. Save it for when I'm closer to the ground."





"Don't even think about it."

"What?"

"You're still thinking about that archive, aren't you?"

"Oh, I thought we were doing a bit."

"No. Are you still thinking about the archive?"

"Yes."

"You said yourself, you need a break. And you're still letting yourself think about it."

"I can't just ignore the possibilities. You've read the Iliad or the Odyssey?"

"Yes, mostly as required reading."

"Well, as you might know, Homer wrote both as records of oral traditions. The idea of what we know as the Trojan War and Odysseus' return to Ithaca is just a copy of some
Greek writer's recollection of oral stories. And stories change."

"I'm with you."

"We all think that the internet is a continuous stream of information, that any data it creates is stored forever. There was a point in history where anything you 
could want to know about the modern day was stored for what you could assume would be perpetuity. Anything you could want to know about the weather in Alaska, or 
current bird populations, or what was popular on TV. Whatever you could think of, it was there, and it would always be there. But the archive is a demonstration of the contrary.
One of those points in history is something we have completely forgotten."

"Well, we hadn't forgotten it entirely. You're calling it 'The Archive' after all."

"Sorry, I thought that made it sound more dramatic. And it was close enough to being erased. At one point it was considered important enough to save to physical storage,
but not enough to preserve by archivists of the past few decades. It was just rotting away in someone's attic by the time I found it, and they were about to dump it.
We were about ready to forget entire swaths of our own history."

"I think it's still less grandiose than you make it out to be. Most of the files on there are pure junk. And the stuff that isn't pure junk is still junk. The actual,
human-authored documents and images that I've seen on there have no meaningful connection to their reality. Few make mention of their present day, and fewer still attempt
to connect what they've made to actual reality. I still think there could be something useful, but I don't think it's as of an important find as you might think. There's less
objectivity as you might like for an archive from the internet."

"That's true, but I think if we look deep enough, we can find something. Even in the junk. You know, I was just looking at a file, and I keep thinking about it."

"What file?"

"It was a README for someone's college programming class. I think at some point it had information like a file list, like:

Arithmetic.cpp - Performs arithemtic operations on two numbers. Usage: `./Arithmetic <infile> <outfile>`. Make with `make`.
BigInteger.cpp and BigInteger.h - Implementation of really large numbers using linked lists.
BigIntegerTest.cpp - Performs tests for BigInteger.cpp. Usage: `./BigIntegerTest`. Make with `make BigIntegerTest`.
List.cpp and List.h - Implementation of linked list ADT.
ListTest.cpp - Performs tests for List.cpp. Usage: `./ListTest`. Make with `make ListTest`.
README - This file.

Clean all made executables with `make clean`."

"What?"

"Sorry, was just sort of thinking aloud there. But that was the only functional part of the file. The rest of it was wrapped in some kind of inane story. The story itself had 
no kind of bearing on the actual importance of the readme file, and it only served to detract from the readme's readability. At some point, it reached a point of meta navel-gazing
that I found off-putting, but I digress."

"Oh, I think I see what you're getting at. Even in the most useless subjectivity, there's a nugget of objectivity."

"Or even the other way around. I have no idea why anyone would want to spend time writing meaningless stories in a readme file, but maybe in some way it reflects common consciousness.
Maybe all of the documents on the archive are all junk, but..."

"Maybe taken together, they have some kind of useful information about how the world was. It's nice to think, and I hope you do get something out of the archive. But for now,
do me a favor?"

"What kind of favor?"

"Just relax, and take in the view. Even if you manage to recover something, it still has the chance of being forgotten years and years later. So forget the archive for a little while,
and indulge yourself in the present."

They both looked out over the vast expanse from the building's edge. "It really is beautiful."
