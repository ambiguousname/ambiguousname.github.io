"Let me see Doctor... Allature?" The receptionist slipped the ID back over to Allature.

After a few seconds of focused typing, Allature realised she should probably say something. "Yes."

"Doctor... Jane Allature?" The receptionist properly focused on Allature.

"Yes." Allature turned to consult the hospital map on a nearby wall. She was trying to find her patient... there. Found it. Allature started off.

"Are you okay?" Allature paused, turning back towards the receptionist.

"Yes. Why do you ask?"

"It's just, well... you look pretty... disheveled." The receptionist had no doubt noticed Allature's general appearance and demeanor. Doctor Jane Allature, in her current form,
was slouching, and her hair and skin were generally untreated and unkempt. "And not to be rude, but you kinda smell it."

"Oh, I see." Allature absent-mindedly slapped herself on the wrist. "I will take care of it later." And she abruptly left to get her patient.
Allature had to put in some effort to shrug off the stares she was recieving from the other doctors and guests. Silently, she tried to force her self to consider some method
of beautification to shake off this unwanted attention. It wasn't too happy with this prospect. It tried muddling with some treatment or another, but it took some time to realize
it might need to consult some other source. Probably a human one. Ugh.

After an eternity of tormenting itself with these moronic and absurd notions, it had arrived at her patient's room. Allature took a moment to survey. It could have been worse.
The door was steel, with a small glass window meant primarily for doctors and nurses to check in on the occupants. There was also a window overlooking the hospital's central yard,
to let in natural sunlight and to prevent the deterioration of any patient's sanity. And both windows were reinforced, just in case. In addition to windows and doors, there was
Allature's patient, shackled to the bed and hooked up to a feeding tube and an EEG monitor. The report she had read described the patient as "in a state of constant seizure,
which confuses the hell out of me." This seemed to be absolutely true; Allature could currently see the patient thrashing around in its restraints and generally following
whatever impulse its brain could try to follow. Allature opened the door. Immediately she could hear the noise from the patient's efforts. The report had described a need
to move the patient to "a sound-dampened room/cell so as to avoid disrupting and distracting other hospital occupants and personnel." Allature stepped in to the patient's room,
then closed the door.

Allature tried to speak. "Hello, um... What... do... I call you? Not that you will understand-" Allatured let a low growl, and slapped itself on the forehead. "-stupid!"

The patient only replied with a series of grunts, bites, and howls.

"Friend, I have a way to... speed it up. Let me just get out my phone." Allature placed it next to the patient's bed. "Now I just have to pull up... Why am I talking?
I already *fixed* this." Allature growled again (albeit at a slightly higher pitch). "These stupid chemicals, I... Damn it, I am doing it again!" It tried to suppress the
bubbling anger that was slowly overcoming her. Failing that, she violently moved her hand over her mouth; maybe with this effort, she wouldn't speak absent-mindedly. Allature
brought out a few opioids and inserted them through the patient's feeding tube. While the doctor in charge of this patient's care might be concerned about inserting semi-random
medications into any patient, Allature at least understood the affliction better than any doctor. While the patient was busy "calming down", Allature was busy grabbing
her phone. She unlocked the screen, and...

She let out another frustrated grunt. Now all that useless information would be stuck in her head for the rest of time, and all for the *wrong* program! She'd move her hand
in a slapping motion, if it wasn't already holding her mouth, so she squeezed down. Stupid, stupid... why? She exited out of the readme and pulled up the program; it had taken some 
time to get this thing working just right, and it was hopefully *not* a complete waste. She let the program play, and it hurriedly spit out English phrases and sentences as fast as 
it was possible to. In between those sections, there were some bursts of static. After an hour or two, the patient seemed to thankfully recognize the noise for what it was meant to be.
He sat upright. "I really... really really hate this."

Allature was at least a little pleased with her success, and so she let go of her mouth. "I think I have a way for things to become... normal. That... err... contemptuous..." Allature
was having a little difficulty coming up with the right words. "that contemptuous... contemptuous... thing of an upstart human," There they are. "screwed us. I think I have a way for 
us to find him, and maybe... reverse everything. But we will need the others. Even with what we have, these forms are... entirely limiting."

The patient nodded. "I... despise being... all of this. It is... like he is... no, it is like... pure mockery. I am being mocked. I cannot... wait to make that contemptuous thing...
*hurt*."
