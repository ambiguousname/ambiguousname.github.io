Dr. Insidious busy emptying round after round his so-called "Decimator" into Larry and Sue's general direction. Larry was hurriedly constructing and re-constructing his force field. <!--more-->
It took only moments for Dr. Insidious to drain the field of its power, only for Larry to somehow find the energy to fortify his barrier. He was trying to buy time for both Sue and I
to come up with a plan to K.O. Insidious. There were a few problems with that, though.

The biggest one was Larry's forcefield. It completely stops anything from passing through. That includes air and light. So I couldn't communicate with anyone inside.
And if Larry somehow managed to survive Dr. Insidious' onslaught, he'd eventually suffocate. To make matters worse, Sue was inside the forcefield with Larry. If she tried
to charge up her abilities, she'd just waste their oxygen supply, and there was no guarantee that when Larry dropped the field Sue could immediately take down Insidious with
whatever she had.

And then there was me. Insidious thought he killed me a few minutes ago by crushing me with the ceiling. I managed to escape the collapsing rubble, and was now hiding
behind some demolished concrete, watching as Larry's protection lost layer after layer. I had to do something, but... what the hell was I going to do? The only thing I had
was my drone, which was still circling the battlefield. I tried to incapacitate Insidious by stunning him, but he had some kind of protection against the noise. Then he got close, 
grabbed the gun, and broke it on his knee. So I tried to use the flying drone to neutralize him. Unlike my useless gun, the drone actually used physical projectiles, and I had
even managed to hit him with one of its heavy-duty bean bags a few times. But today, all I managed to do was graze him with a can of pepper spray. I couldn't really believe it. 
I had parked the damn thing high up in the sky, activated its cloak, and then just lobbed projectile after projectile at him. He *still* managed to see them coming. 

I really regret not designing any kind of hard-hitting offensive weaponry. I had made the mistake in assuming that evil geniuses or superheroes would be receptive to the same kinds 
of pain that other humans were. I mean, it HURT when I got hit with Maenonocle's pepper spray; I thought Insidious would have a similar reaction. But I guess that's why he's the evil
genius. I swear, if I ever manage to get out of this, I'm making some lethal rounds. That might put me close to people with actual smarts or super powers.

I got lost in my own train of thought again. Insidious is still going to kill Larry and Sue. I need to do something or we're done for. Again, my drone is still alive, but
Insidious seems to just know when it's in range. But it's the only thing I have, so I pull up the drone's controls. It's a terminal. I found that having a graphical interface
with manual control is actually less helpful than just providing commands directly to the drone. Its program is more advanced at flying and targeting than any human could be.

While I'm looking at the terminal, my eyes wander to the logfile that I have set up to show the drone's activity. Then I look up, at the partially collapsed roof.

That son of a-

He's CHEATING! He has a steel antenna MOUNTED on one of the walls. I thought it was just for the aesthetics. It isn't, and I'm a complete idiot. I control my drone using frequencies
near the Super Low Frequency band, which I thought made me clever. I'm the only person I know of capable of making a SLF transmitter that could fit in my hand. No one else would even
think of detecting radio signals on lower frequencies, right? What makes it even worse is that you don't need a gigantic antenna to pick up the signal. So it's clear Insidious is just
rubbing it in my face. 

There's one saving grace. Unless he was able to build the same SLF transmitter that I have, which I highly doubt, then he's probably just able to read the data that my terminal and 
drone are transmitting. That includes data like positioning, projected firing strength, wind speed, the list goes on.  The reason my can of  pepper spray worked but not my 
near-unlimited supply of bean bags was because I had used those bean bags before. I had JUST installed the pepper spray today.

So, any data I transmit to my drone is now suspect. I think I have a plan, though. I start scrolling through the terminal's files. I just need some kind of program to print out 
semi-random garbage. Any kind of program will do. I eventually find "Shuffle.cpp". I quickly skim the README:

## File Descriptions:

```
List.cpp and List.h - Implementation of List ADT.
ListTest.cpp - File for testing implementation of List ADT. Make with
`make ListTest`. Makefile - Makefile for compiling everything.
README - This file.
Shuffle.cpp - File for getting number of "Perfect Shuffles" for a deck
until the deck is back into its original position. Make with `make`,
use with `./Shuffle <size of deck>`
```

Okay, this could work. I type `make`, to make Shuffle. I quickly make a script to take the output of ./Shuffle for a few different values and to transmit its output.
The drone thankfully won't do anything with this output. I didn't encrypt my terminal's transmissions, but I at least had the sense to make the drone not execute garbage 
it detects with its reciever. In the same script, I make sure the terminal sends the drone a few pre-scripted commands in-between the bursts of ./Shuffle's pre-determined outputs.
Checking my drone's ammo, it looks like it only has 3 bean bags left. I sure did waste a lot of ammunition, but it should have to do. Then I put the whole thing on a timer. 
I lay the terminal down, and get out of cover. I'm about to make what will probably be the greatest double bluff I could ever think of. I pray that it works.

"Insidious!" I yell out. Please don't die, please don't die...

Insidious turns to me. He's still firing his gun at Larry's barrier. If Larry could actually see through the barrier, he might decide that now would be a good time to lower the field,
get out of the way, and unleash hell on Insidious. But again, the force field doesn't let light through. So Larry can't see crap. And I'm screwed. Insidious chuckles.
"You're still alive! That's a nice surprise. You can watch as your friends suffocate to death. I wonder if the field will drop when Gary breathes his last hideous breath, or
if it will stay there permanently, encasing them in a permanent bubble of their own choking despair."

"Insidious! It ends here. I have you surrounded." My hands are shaking. He's not buying this.

"Oh, by all means, arrest me." He's still firing on the barrier. Larry's shielding seems to be getting weaker. I take a step forward. Where is my drone? I think back
to my last steps. I ran my script for a few times, I'm nearly certain that it will work. Maybe I made an error in calling the program to convert the data into an SLF transmission?

"Insidious, you are under arrest for..."

Insidious lets out another laugh. "You're really going to arrest me? I thought you were just grand-standing me. This is too good." I take another step forward. Then I actually
see the bean bag nearly hit Insidious. It lands on his foot with the force of a brick. He howls, and hops up and down. "For all your--huuuhh," He's trying to speak while sucking
in air, "sss-for all your efforts, you're still doomed... aaaaahhhhh- I'm going to kill you first, then your friends. Then we won't ever have to repeat these moronic stunts
ever again." He seems to have recovered, although he's now walking towards me. He's limping, at least.

The second bean bag lands to his right. He shifts over just in time to avoid it. Looks like whatever is feeding him information has adapted to my drone's new strategy. I hope the two
shots are enough of a correlation for his predictive program. Even hobbling on his foot, he's speedy. He reaches me in no time, and pins me with his arm. I'm surprised at how strong
some evil geniuses are. He aligns his Decimator with my body.

"Before I finish you off, I thought it might be funny to let you know that you're worse than you realize. Your drone, the one you think you're so clever about hiding? I know where it is."
I try to do my best surprised face. "Yeah. That antenna, over there?" He points to the antenna. "It's letting me in on ALL of your secrets. I was able to catch your chatter over the radio,
I was able to figure out your plan, and I was able to find your drone. You tried to tangle with the best, and you stood no chance. I give you a solid F for Effort. Now..."

Behind Insidious, I see the speeding projectil of the final beanbag. Insidious is already moving to the right to dodge. Then it hits him square on the head.
He lets out a violent "UMPH!" and collapses. I try not to look down. I swear I can almost see his head shape *bend*, which is not a pretty sight. Being so close, his head
lands right into my lap, and I think I feel some fluids. Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ewwwwwww.

I stand up very quickly. He's probably still alive, but he's most likely missing just a little bit of his blood. Either way, he won't be getting up for a while. I go back to my terminal. 
No point in going over to Larry's force field, he'll eventually figure out that Insidious has stopped firing on it. I recall my drone, and type:

```
make clean
```

to remove the ./Shuffle program and its associated files.
