title: Fixing Stories
summary: John tries to convince Aghast to do something wildly unthinkable. And morally objectionable.

"Listen, Aghast, the Council of Seven is going to deliberate on your case. They'll spend some amount of time arguing about the benefits and costs to send 
the Praetorians to the Eastern Kingdoms to stop Richard VIII.<!--more--> They might even send a scouting party. But they'll eventually say no, and it might even take
weeks for them to say no. But mark my words, they will say no."

"How are you so certain?" Aghast was somewhat disturbed by John's determination. "You haven't even heard what I'm going to say."

"I've seen this play a hundred times, in a hundred different ways. But there are always constants. I could make up some explanation about the nature of power
and how the Council is afraid of changes or threats to their control. And in some ways, it's true. They'll bury their heads in the sand for as long as there is 
proof that they can refute."

"I have irrefutable proof! Personal accounts from multiple people, including myself showing Richard VIII's cruel tyranny. If they even bothered to look at the flames
that pollute-"

"I get it, I really do. Listen, whatever speech you have prepared will fall on deaf ears. Even with undeniable proof, the Council will ignore you. That might
say something about politics, but it has more to do with the nature of stories than pure ignorance. Tell me, who greeted you when you first arrived at the Council's
doorstep?"

"That'd be the fourth Elder of the Council, Gregor of Tala-Ur."

"Then that's who we have to kill." John grabbed a small box off a shelf, and placed it very delicately on the table. Aghast could see it was quite dusty.

"I'm sorry, what? We can't kill anyone... especially one of the SEVEN COUNCIL MEMBERS!"

"Keep it down a little. Someone might overhear." John opened the lid of the box. "Do you know what this is?" Aghast glanced at the box's contents. 
It was full of this fine, green, and glowing powder.

"I don't care about what's inside the box! You're talking about murder."

"Okay, maybe I haven't explained clearly enough. There's always a traitor. They're going to do everything they can to make sure that your evidence doesn't sway the council.
So, always be suspicious of whoever meets with you first. We might be able to get a few other council members though, just to be safe."

"Wait, so is this... some kind of explosive? Even if I believed what you were saying, that means that you'd be targeting innocent Council members as well. This is unconscionable!"

"Do you want to save your friends? Your family? This is how you do it. Gregor of Tala-Ur, or whoever else, is going to do everything he can to make sure that you're on your own.
Then you'll have nothing. You'll have to endure so much pain and suffering just to get to Richard VIII and death in his court is a near-guarantee. Even if you don't die, almost
everyone you care about will perish. We can frame the deaths as part of Richard VIII's scheme to weaken the council and conquer the lands, and by that point the remaining
Council members would have no choice but to rally the Praetorians against Richard VIII, even if there were still a traitor amongst them."

"You make it sound so definitive, but you have no idea! You're just guessing! Even if my evidence doesn't sway the council, there's always another way."

"Something always said by the true idiots of history. There are always other ways, but they never work. Because the established methods are there for a reason.
I have seen this play out over and over again, and I know how this will work. I'm here to help, because if you do this your way, nothing will change. 
The Council members will die, and no matter whether or not Richard VIII will win or lose, he'll have forced the entire world back into the dark ages. 
You'll have to spend time rebuilding, and you'll just give rise to the next Council, and the next Richard VIII. This way, there are only minor setbacks and less deaths."

"I don't believe you. You still haven't convinced me that you know for certain this is going to happen." Aghast turned to leave.

"I wish you had a better sense of perspective just so you could see how predictable you are. You have the ability to make choices, to change things about yourself,
but all you do is fall into the same habits. Why can't you see that's what's happening now? The beats are going again, playing in the same order they always have."

"Wait, what was that?"

"If I told you, I doubt it'd change your mind. But it doesn't really matter anyway, because I think I finally get it now. I thought you at least had a modicum of individuality as
some kind of Chosen One, but you're just as bound to the story. Maybe even moreso. But I get it, now, finally. There's always a protagonist and conflict. I just have to reframe
the antagonism so that Richard VII is useless by the time he arrives."

"What the hell are you talking about? What do you even mean?" Agahst was inching towards the door. John was probably about to do something really dangerous and really stupid, and he
did not want to be within range when it happened.

"Be seeing you." And John just... vanished.
