<!--more-->DO YOU DARE TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE WONDERS OF LEX.C? IT USES THE MOST MAJESTIC OF FUNCTIONS:
```
strcmp
```

TO COMPARE LINES OF WORDS FROM AN INPUT FILE AND SORT THEM ALPHABETICALLY. YOU WOULD BE DOOM-ED IF I HAD NOT HELD THIS BEAST AT BAY. 
IF YOU DARE TO UNLEASH THE GREATEST OF EVIL, THAT YOU MAY DARE GAIN ACCESS TO THE FORBIDDEN MAGIC, YOU MUST DO NO MORE THAN SPEAK THE WORDS
```
make
```

OR SOME EQUIVALENT AS DESCRIBED IN Makefile INTO YONDER BASH TERMINAL. THEN ALL YOU WOULD NEED TO CREATE A THOUSAND YEARS OF DARKNESS WOULD BE TO TYPE
```
Lex <input file> <output file>
```
INTO THAT VERY SAME TERMINAL. THEN YOU WOULDST SEE DESTRUCTION WROUGHT FROM Lex AS IT SORTED THE VERY WORDS YOU SPEAK, TWISTING THEM AGAINST
YOU INTO A DIABOLICAL LEXIGRAPHICAL ORDER.

BUT FEAR NOT, THERE IS HOPE. 

THERE EXISTS A PROPHECY OF A CHOSEN ONE. OF ONE WHO IS ABLE TO DEFEAT THE FILE OF EXECUTION. IF YOU WISH TO UNWROUGHT THE DESTRUCTION FROM 
THE BOTTLE OF MALEVOLENCE THAT YOU HAVE UNWITTINGLY UNCORKED, YOU ONLY NEED FIND THIS CHOSEN ONE AND GRANT THEM ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER.
THEN IF THEY ARE WORTHY, THEY MUST TYPE THE FOLLOWING INTO YOUR TERMINAl:
```
make clean
```
THIS WILL DISPEL THAT GREAT EVIL. USE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOUR PERIL, OR YOU MAY YET FACE THE WRATH OF VECNA.
