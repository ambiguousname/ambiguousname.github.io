"I'm in."

"I... know that."

"Well, I thought you might not know."

"Is this your first time using a jack?"
<!--more-->
"No! I've done it tons of times!"

"Well, if it WEREN'T your first time, you'd know that your monitor shows me what you see. And seeing as how I'm two feet away from you and looking at your monitor..."

"So... you can see that I'm in?"

"Have you been listening to a word I've been saying?"

"It's hard to do two things at once! It's ... not my first time in uh... cyberspace, and I know what I'm doing."

"I am trying really hard not to assault your defenseless body right now. Can you just get to a terminal?"

"Oh, yes! I can see a few things. It looks like a program description."

"Alright, let me know what it says."

"'List of Files: 

FindComponents.c - Takes one input and one output file. Input file should be structured according to pa3.pdf. Generally, though:
\# of Vertices
Edge#1 Edge#2
Edge#1 Edge#2
...
0 0'

Graph.c-'"

"You don't need to read the whole thing. Just skim it and give me the important parts."

"'Graph.c - This one stores an implementation for a Graph.

Graph.h - This is what should be #include-d to access the implementation of the Graph.

GraphTest.c - The alternative built to GraphClient.c (not included). Tests all of the functions in Graph.c.

List.c - An implementation of a List. Borrowed from pa1.

List.h - Same as above, but for a header file.'

Makefile - 'A makefile used for building the programs. See below for usage.'

README - 'This file.'"

"Are you able to follow instructions?"

"What kind of question is that?"

"One that reflects my growing worry. What did I *just* tell you about reading the file?"

"You wanted me to tell you what it said!"

"I asked you to skim. SKIM. You understand what SKIM means, right?"

"Listen, you asked for the file, I read you the file."

"I feel like you don't know what skim means."

"I KNOW what skim means. Look, can we just move on?"

"Okay, okay. So, to build the thing you're gonna want to type in:

make

or 

make GraphTest

to build the testing software."

"Do I want to build the testing software?"

"I guess not. Oh hey, there's an option here for

make GraphClient!"

"I wouldn't try it, GraphClient isn't included among the files, you'd have to add that manually from the CSE 101 website."

"The terminal is on fire."

"I TOLD YOU NOT TO TRY IT!"

"Well, I thought it might throw up an error or something, not catch fire!"

"Terminals spontaneously combust as a visual and tactile way of communicating errors."

"Well, that's just dumb. Can I still use the terminal?"

"Yes. Just use make. Please."

"Okay, and so now I use ./FindComponents <infile> <outfile> to run the program?"

"... I'm surprised you figured that out. Yes."

"Oh wait, there's a make clean option!"

"Please don't use that."

"I wonder what it does?"

"Please don't use that."

"Is there like a clean.c file?"

"... Please please please please DON'T use that."

"I typed it in."

"PLEASE. DO NOT. USE THAT."

"I hit enter, I think it's removing some files."

"That's it, I give up. Good luck writing your README file, moron."
