summary: Ginley dies. Horribly.

"I need one moment." I heard a loud WUMPH! as Ginley's knees gave out. Or at least, Ginley's approximation of knees. "I'm not feeling too well. Things are much worse."
<!--more-->
"Ginley, I told you not to pull any of this kind of crap with me. If you're hurt, you have to vocalize it."

"The damage was okay at first. I think Sheo hit me with a virus. All of my runes are-"Ginley's eyes flickered to darkness. Then, just as suddenly, its eyes sprung back to full luminance. I could make out some text as it scrolled through:

## List of files:
```
FindPath.c - "This one takes one input and one output file. Output file
should be structured according to pa2.pdf.
Simply put, though:
# Vertices
Edge#1 Edge#2
Edge#1 Edge#2
...
0 0
VertexStart VertexEnd
VertexStart VertexEnd
0 0"

Graph.c - "This one stores an implementation for a Graph."

Graph.h - "This is what should be #include-d to access the implementation
of the Graph."

GraphTest.c - "The alternative built to GraphClient.c (not included).
Tests all of the functions in Graph.c."

List.c - "An implementation of a List. Borrowed from pa1."

List.h - "Same as above, but for a header file."

Makefile - "A makefile used for building the programs. See below for usage."

README - "This file."

```

"Ginley, I have no idea what any of this means. Ginley, are you there? Ginley?"

"Time is running out. Take this." Ginley handed me a perfectly smooth stone. I reached out to take it.

"What is this thing? It feels soft, squishy. Wait, wait, I've just hit a part where it's weirdly damp and... eww. It's all sticky. What did you just give to me?"

## How to use:
"Listen, all you need is to run 
```
make
```
to build FindPath. You can also use

```
make GraphTest
```
to build GraphTest or
```
make GraphClient
```
if you add GraphClient to the file structure (the file doesn't currently exist. I just kept this in case I decided to add GraphClient.c back in for my own testing)."

"You're not making any sense."

"Losing the approximation of vital organs tends to make you delirious. I think I'm seeing something about using
```
make checkFind
```
or
```
make checkClient
```
or
```
make checkTest
```
to test each of the appropriate .c files for memory leaks. You could also just run
```
./FindPath <input> <output>
```
or
```
./GraphTest
```
or
```
./GraphClient
```
Once the appropriate .c files have been built." I tried interrupting several times, but no matter what I said, Ginley was completely unresponsive. Then it turned to me.

"And make sure to
```
make clean
```
to clean the appropriate executables and .o files."

"The stone, Ginley, what about the stone?"

"I just told you about everything. I think I have to shut my eyes for a while, but it was nice to be kidnapped and forced to be in your employ."

"Ginley. Ginley... Ginley! Stay awake. You can't quit on me. I still need more from you. I'll fire you if you don't get up right now."

"Remember when we met? Sheo had shackled me into being a guard dog. I may not have said it at the time, but you threatening Sheo was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. You forced me into going so far... into doing so much..."

"Ginley, please. Don't quit on me."

"I wonder if they have... amalgams in the afterlife."

"There is no afterlife, Ginley, you have to stay here. Ginley!"

Ginley's bulbous blue optics dulled completely. I gripped the stone in my hand. There would be no time for a burial. Sheo was still on the move, and they had a lot to answer for.

"Wait, wait. I am going to be fine." I turned back. Ginley reached out with an arm to correct itself upright.

And then Ginley exploded.
